**Max Fordham Engineering Development Best Practice**

This documentation aims to provide high-level, non-verbose notes outlining Max Fordham's engineering software development infrastructure.
Links to external sources and standards to describe the approach are preferred where possible.
The intended audience are those contributing-to and maintaining internal development tools, or external parties and collaborators interested in our approach.
Code snippets are encouraged.

**We stand on the shoulders of giants**. Our software is built on robust, high-quality opensource packages, and we are proud to share the work that we produce with the opensource community.
When writing code there are always many solutions to a problem;
we standardise the technologies we use for a given task to ensure a consistent approach across projects. See below for key technologies on which we rely.

 we develop scripts to automate tasks using the open APIs available within our core softwares.

It helps you quickly sketch out your automation and add-on ideas, in whichever language that you are most comfortable with, inside the Revit environment and using its APIs.")

**[deploying](deploying.md)**
^^^
 a server hosted jupyterhub gives all Max Fordham users access to jupyter notebooks and apps.  the server is setup, deployed and updated using ansible. the jupyterhub repo2docker plugin creates docker images of apps and notebook environments. see [jupyterhub-maxfordham](https://github.com/gunstonej/jupyterhub-maxfordham) for MF setup and configuration. the work was done by quantstack, and copies a previous set-up they configured [plasmabio](https://docs.plasmabio.org/en/latest/overview/index.html).

The image build process is based on the configuration files found in the repository.")

 insight can be extract from structured data. our automation tools create structured data that is passed to databases for global review and analysis.

It is used for production-grade tools.")
