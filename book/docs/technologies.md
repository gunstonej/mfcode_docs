# Technologies

**We stand on the shoulders of giants**. Our software is built on robust, high-quality opensource packages, and we are proud to share the work that we produce with the opensource community.
When writing code there are always many solutions to a problem;
we standardise the technologies we use for a given task to ensure a consistent approach across projects. See below for key technologies on which we rely.
