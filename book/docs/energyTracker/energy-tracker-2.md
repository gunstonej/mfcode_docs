# Energy Tracker testing and Development

## [energy tracker API - Swagger UI](https://energytrackerapi20211206093928.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html)

## Questions for Matt

- there is no data already in the database? 
    - is it possible to add the old data? 
- generally, it would be useful to add references for definitions (ideally in the schema) of terms (e.g. in `/SectorsAndTypologiesâ€‹/AddSectorsAndTypesToProject`): 
    - use: 
    - category: 
    - sector: 
    - type: 
    - ^ ideally the above would all have accompanying references from literature
    - (i'm currently not sure how to add Sectors / Types to my project)
- is UTC time used generally (current working assumption). required for expiry response for auth.
    - if yes, add to description in schema.
- when project is initiated with POST /Projects/Project, in the sample request: ```{"yourReferenceKey": "MyKey"}```, it should be ```{"referenceKey": "MyKey"}```
- ProjectCreationShell --> accessType: is there an enum of allowed values?
- "isFinalDesign" within Sessions
    - can't see how to set "isFinalDesign" (its not in the PUT or POST commands within Sessions)
    - within a Session, we should define the convention within the schema for how "isFinalDesign" can be used. suggest that:
        - for a given "methodology", there can only be 1no "isFinalDesign" 
        - can this be enforced by validation within the schema? 

## Workflow of Tool 

- JG is in the process of making a tool for extracting data from an IES model and inputting into EnergyTracker
- it is intentionally limited in scope as a way to: 
    - experiment with the API on a small project
    - embed the eTracker into other best-practice modelling workflows to increase likelihood of Engineers inputting the data

```{code-cell} ipython3
import base64
from IPython.display import Image, display
def mm(graph):
    """plot mermaid diagram in notebook"""
    graphbytes = graph.encode("ascii")
    base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(graphbytes)
    base64_string = base64_bytes.decode("ascii")
    display(Image(url="https://mermaid.ink/img/" + base64_string))

```

## Other Notes

- because the swagger.json file is built to the openapi standard it has been possible to convert the swagger.json files into python [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) models [datamodel-code-generator](https://koxudaxi.github.io/datamodel-code-generator/)
    - this makes development using python much more streamlined! 
- [vuetify-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/koumoul-dev/vuetify-jsonschema-form) can be used to generate out-the-box UI forms from the schema
