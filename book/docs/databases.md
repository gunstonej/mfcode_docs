# databases

Engineering tools with defined inputs and outputs create the opportunity for recording data used from a given job.
Thus far, as a general rule, all jobs have the files they need to run the apps saved on a file-server within the appropriate job.
Additional functionality is gained my collating this data into SQL databases, and trends are analysed and fed back to the
for enhanced functionality or collated, reviewd and summarised by Engineering Standards.

## SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a python toolkit and object relational mapper (ORM) for handling SQL databases in python.
There are many ORMs, but this seems like the best, it can interact with many different types of SQL database.
