## Branch Names

The branch names on jupyterhub-maxfordham must not contain any full-stops, otherwise the "Launch" button does not working correctly.

For example, ipypdt repo is used for the equipment-schedule-maker. If we were to create a branch from the tag 0.1.4 (in git), we would
name the branch equipment-schedule-maker-v0_1_4.
