# Workflow Orchestration tools

## Big Players

- Apache Airflow: _developed by AirBnB, large, feature-rich, too complex for us_
- Luigi: _developed by spotify, large, feature-rich, but easier to get going. maybe._
- Prefect: _advertised as Airflow next-gen. fully featured. opensource core. large, feature-rich. maybe._
- Snakemake: _simpler than ^. more academic. based on file inputs and outputs. linux only ðŸ˜¢. maybe._
- Pollination Queenbee: _workflow language that creates Luigi pipelines from yaml's. looks great. yaml --> luigi converter is closed source. only to be used with Pollination Cloud_
