## JuptyerHub Server

The general development environment is a JupyterHub server (Linux Ubuntu 20.04) that is accessible to everyone and independent of any other software. Conda / Mamba is used for package management (see later) meaning there is robust version control and record of previous versions.

Refer to:
[jupyterhub-maxfordham](https://github.com/gunstonej/jupyterhub-maxfordham)
for the repo developed by QuantStack that automates processes on the JupyterHub server.
