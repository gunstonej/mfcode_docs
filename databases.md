# databases

Engineering tools with defined inputs and outputs create the opportunity for recording data used from a given job.
Thus far, as a general rule, all jobs have the files they need to run the apps saved on a file-server within the appropriate job.
Additional functionality is gained my collating this data into SQL databases, and trends are analysed and fed back to the
for enhanced functionality or collated, reviewd and summarised by Engineering Standards.

## MySQL

Historically accounts / admin use MySQL. This is soon to be DEPRECATED.

## Postgres SQL databases

Accounts / admin are moving to Postgres. New databases to be built like this.
## SQLlite

For lightweight apps and prototyping, SQLlite is great.

## Speckle Server

Creates a "SpeckleStream" from the Revit model to PostgresSQL databases. TBC.
