### Software Automation

Our primary software also create significant opportunity for software automation:

- pyRevit
- IES VEscripts
- Rhino + Grasshopper + Python (Light and Air only)


- runs Ubuntu with JupyterHub. Configured by [Quantstack](https://quantstack.net/), similar (but smaller) setup to what they did for [PlasmaBio](https://docs.plasmabio.org/en/latest/)
  - used for:
  - voila dashboards
  - involved engineering tools with heavy interface requirements
  - generating automated report outputs

### Utitilty scripts / customisations of Max Fordham's core software

Primarily:

- pyRevit
- ISE VEscripts

#### pyRevit

pyRevit is used to automate Revit processes. It is described as RAD (Rapid Application Development), making it fast to build utility scripts the Revit application.
